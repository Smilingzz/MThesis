### Masters thesis

This is my Masters thesis Github repository. I'm conducting my masters thesis spring semester of 2024. The repository will be updated continously. 

Initial plan*:
- January and February: 
  - Preliminary simulations in SUMO. Proof-of-concept attacks with Sybil attacker utilizing different attack scenarios.
- March and April:
  - Perform data analysis and propose defence mechanism. Conduct further simulations based on defence mechanism. Analyze data.
- May:
  - Final paper writing.

*I aim to write on the paper continously alongside all other matters up to May as well.
